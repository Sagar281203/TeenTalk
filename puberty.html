				      <strong>Puberty is a natural and significant stage of development during which a child's body undergoes various physical and emotional changes, marking the transition from childhood to adolescence. This process is triggered by hormonal changes that stimulate the development of reproductive organs and the secondary sexual characteristics. It typically occurs between the ages of 8 and 14 in girls and 9 to 16 in boys.</strong>

                   <p style="font-size: 1.8rem;">

                    Girls: Experience the development of breasts, the growth of pubic hair, and the onset of menstruation, marking the beginning of the menstrual cycle. <br> <br>
                    Boys: Undergo enlargement of the testes, growth of pubic hair, and development of facial and body hair.

                        <strong>4. Voice Changes: <br> </strong>  <br>
                        Boys may experience a deepening of the voice due to the growth of the larynx (Adam's apple).

    
                       </p>
